# Innovative_Teaching_Feedback
The Innovative Teaching Feedback System allows faculty to upload class activities with details like title, media, and course info, while students provide feedback through ratings and comments. With separate dashboards for students and faculty, it enhances engagement, improves teaching quality, and fosters interactive learning.
